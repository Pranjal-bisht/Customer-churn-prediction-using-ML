# Employee churn prediction
1> Applied machine learning to predict which customer churned out from an organisation based on features like Credit score, Gender, Geography,etc.


2> Used Sklearn library for preprocessing of data. It offers amazing functions to normalize, split the data for training and testing.


3> Used Keras to build the neural network and used Relu as activation function in between the layers and sigmoid function to predict whether a person left the organisation or not.


4> Upon compilation the acheived an accuracy of 82% on test set whearas an accuraccy of 83% on the train set which shows the overfitting of the model.
